   - Same-day pickup available
   - Specific time slots instead of time ranges
   - Focus on meal preparation time

3. **Content**
   - Restaurant history and awards
   - Emphasis on recipes and tradition
   - Community gathering place messaging

### 📱 Responsive Design

- Mobile-first approach
- Touch-friendly cart controls
- Readable menu on all devices
- Optimized for older smartphones

### 🏁 Final Checklist
