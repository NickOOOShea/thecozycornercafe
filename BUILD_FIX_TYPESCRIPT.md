# 🚀 Restaurant Template Build Fix - TypeScript Error Resolved

## ❌ Build Error
The Netlify build was failing with:
```
Type error: Types of property 'available' are incompatible.
  Type 'string' is not assignable to type 'boolean'.
```

## ✅ Fixed Issues

### 1. **Desserts Menu Item** (`src/content/menu/desserts.json`)
- Changed `"available": "seasonal"` to `"available": false` for Peach Cobbler
- The seasonal note is already displayed separately via the `note` field

### 2. **MenuItem Component** (`src/components/MenuItem.tsx`)
- Removed the check for `item.available === 'seasonal'`
- Simplified to only check boolean values
- Seasonal items now show as "Not Available" with their seasonal note

## 📋 Changes Made

1. **desserts.json** - Line 40:
   ```json
   // Before:
   "available": "seasonal",
   
   // After:
   "available": false,
   ```

2. **MenuItem.tsx** - Removed conditional for 'seasonal' string

## 🎯 Result
- All `available` properties are now consistently boolean
- TypeScript types match the actual data
- Build should now succeed

## 🚀 To Deploy

```bash
cd N:\appalachian-connect-restaurant-template
git add .
git commit -m "Fix TypeScript error: available property now consistently boolean"
git push
```

Netlify will automatically rebuild and deploy.

## 💡 Alternative Approach (Not Used)
We could have updated the TypeScript interface to allow `available: boolean | 'seasonal'`, but keeping it as a simple boolean is cleaner and the seasonal information is already handled via the `note` field.
